/**
 * Product lineup and routing. Converting the template to another game:
 *
 * 1. Set the game in `src/config/game.ts` and the brand/domain in `src/config/site.ts` / `site-url.mjs`.
 * 2. Pick the utilities this site sells in `UTILITY_PRODUCT_SLUGS` below. Removing a slug drops its
 *    page, menu and footer links, cards, comparison column, FAQs and sitemap URL.
 * 3. Point checkout links at the right partner URLs in `src/config/checkout-redirects.mjs`.
 * 4. Rewrite the game-specific copy: cheat product (`src/i18n/en.ts` `cheats`, `src/data/products.ts`
 *    `elite`), homepage sections, page SEO, blog and forum posts, plus their es/de/fr JSON files.
 *    Utility copy is game-neutral and reads the game name from `src/config/game.ts`.
